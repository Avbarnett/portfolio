              <p><img class="img-style-1" src="assets/images/BruceBauerSmall.jpg">Iâ€™m pursuing my degree in applied communication so I can learn how to become the perfect communicator. I always thought communication was something that came naturally to me, given I am a pretty social person, but now I can see there are many theories behind the way we communicate.</p>

Information Technology was not my dream, but I think if I can bring my knowledge from my applied communication classes, ability to work well with others, and various coding skills to this field I can fill a position geared towards project management.
